# AutoInsta

Sadly this is an old project and the instapy cli is out of date and has not currently been updated to the newest version of the instagram API.

Project was designed to automate the process of uploading images and videos to instagram as posts. A user would be able to schedule a post for a time and the image and caption would be automatically posted at that time.
